Two rust crates: reqwest & scraper

We'll scrape the 100 movies list from IMDb. 

Scraping a page usually involves getting the HTML code of the page and then parsing it to find the information you need. 

How browsers work:
- to display a web page, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server 
- the server responds with source code for the web page 
- the browser renders that code 

To get the HTML Source Code for a website, you'll have to mimic the browser with Rust (by sending a GET request).
^ This is what the `reqwest` crate is for. It is an HTTP client. 

why is it reqwest::blocking::get ... i.e. what is the blocking type/method?


The `scraper` crate is used to extract the info you need from the HTML.
It parses the HTML into a tree-like structure.
You can use CSS Selectors to query the elements you're interested in.
You need to check the website, to see which CSS selectors are available.

I think CSS Selectors correspond to `class=` tags within HTML elements.
<span class="lister-item-index unbold text-primary"> I think is the one we want... (It has the name of the movie)

How do I copy the HTML? 

1. find the tag unique to the movie titles 
2. navigate to the <a> tag within that tag 

<h3 class="lister-item-header">
    <span class="lister-item-index unbold text-primary">1.</span>
    <a href="/title/tt0111161/?ref_=adv_li_tt">The Shawshank Redemption</a>
    <span class="lister-item-year text-muted unbold">(1994)</span>
</h3>

^^ you can get this by doing "copy element" 
...

<h3 class="lister-item-header">
        <span class="lister-item-index unbold text-primary">1.</span>
    
    <a href="/title/tt0111161/?ref_=adv_li_tt">The Shawshank Redemption</a>
    <span class="lister-item-year text-muted unbold">(1994)</span>
</h3>

3. create a query with scaper::Selector::parse method 

Youâ€™ll give it a h3.lister-item-header>a selector. In other words, it finds 
<a> tags that have as a parent an <h3> tag that is of a lister-item-header class.

4. Now you can use the query to query your document with the `select` method 


What is `zip` in rust (iterators)?
- zip is typically used to combine iterators into tuples ... so it returns a new iterator with a tuple of 
(iter_1, iter_2) values


How does map work in rust?
- why the  | |?
- map can only be applied to Iterable (Iterator) types 
- any Vec of elements can be converted into an Iterator with `iter()` or `into_iter()`
- Iterable.map(|current item| function(current item))
- collect() method consumes the iterator and collects the resulting values into a collection data type 

Is Vec the same thing as an array in python/java?


Things I need to look into further:
- How to use iterators effectively in Rust 
- How to use Option<> generic types in Rust 
- How is the number genreated from the .zip().for_each() method?
